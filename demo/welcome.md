# Scheduler Validation Mode and Testing

This space contains different Jupyter notebooks
to test the capabilities of the Gemini Scheduler.

**Note:** If you don't see the pickle handling tutorial notebook, you need to update
the bleach dependency. Run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -U bleach
```
