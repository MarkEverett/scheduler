# Configuration Data

This is a hodge-podge of messy data consisting of source files and processing scripts.

These files supply information from science regarding:
* Engineering tasks
* Fault reports
* Weather loss (dome closures)

They are not standardized, and have been processed to the
standard formats in the parent directory. They are here for reference only.
