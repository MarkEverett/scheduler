# TODO: All tests suites should be in this directory but when are run in this 
#       directory, there is a problem when dependencies are not found in the relative path.
#       The workaround is to run the tests in the parent directory 
#       (see `test_horizons_client.py` in root) but this need to be modified. 
#       The issue might come from the use of packages instead of modules in the source code.
